## 1. Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the Crowdventure software, which provides an application that will allow users to play a crowd-sourced choose your own adventure game

### 1.1. Project Deliverables

#### 1.1.1. Software Requirements Document

Due: 2/10/2020

The Software Requirements Specification is to be turned in to the instructor and contain details about the low-level requirements of the Crowdventure project. Specifically, this document will contain an introduction, the breakdown of the CSCI components, functional requirements, performance requirements, and requirements for the project, development, and execution environments. It outlines the gritty details of the contract of the functionality of the application agreed upon between developer (student) and client (instructor).

#### 1.1.2. Software Development Plan

Due: 3/2/2020

This document will detail the software development process that will be used throughout the production of the Crowdventure project, including details about the project deliverables, software and hardware resources, organization, and schedule.

#### 1.1.3. Design Description Document

Due: 3/23/2020

This document will contain current details on the planned implementation of the functionality specified in the Software Requirements Specification. This will require careful analysis of the project design and how the different elements interact and fit together.

#### 1.1.4. Preliminary Presentation

Due: 4/13/2020

This presentation will act as an update to the class and instructor about the progress of the design of the Crowdventure project. It will provide a demonstration of the applicationâ€™s uses in its Alpha or Beta level (nearing the final delivery of the completed application).

#### 1.1.5. Final Project Delivery

Due: 4/27/2020

This presentation will act as an update to the class and instructor about the finalized version of Crowdventure at its formal delivery. It will contain details about the full functionality of the application, challenges the team faced in producing the application, and a demonstration of the use of the application.

The delivery will contain the delivery of the entire finalized project, including its code, documentation, and a final report on the status of the final applications functionality.
