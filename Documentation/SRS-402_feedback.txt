Software Requirements Specification
CMSI 402 -- CrowdVenture Project
======================================

Good start on this document, Ben!

Just a few comments:

You have the requirements language down pretty well, but you need quite a
few more functional requirements.  For a project of this nature you'd be
expected to have [in the industry] probably between 50 and 75 of them.  I
also notice that you have multiple requirements under a single paragraph
number ~ this may not be obvious, but when you have a requirement like:

  "The screen shall be comprised of information describing an artificial
   situation, along with a list of both canon options and non-canon options."

...that should actually be three separate requirements:

  "The screen shall be comprised of information describing an artificial
   situation."

  "The screen shall be comprised of information containing a list of canon
   options."

  "The screen shall be comprised of information containing a list of
   non-canon options."

However, since this is CMSI 402, and not 401, you can re-write all these
requirements as "user stories" which will cut down on the amount.  Try to
follow a format that says:

  "As a <user-role> I want to <some_activity> so that <some_outcome>"

For example, for your GUI section, you should have several user stories
which look something like:

  "As a CrowdVenture user, I want to see information describing an artificial
   situation, so that I can decide what to do next."

I hope that's clear.

For your Administrative backend, I think having only one requirement or user
story [either way] is WAY too little.  There has to be more functionality
associated with the admin panel operations, right?

Try not to use "weasel words" like "proper" administration, because they
are ambiguous.  What is "proper" anyhow?  Proper to whom?  They call 'em
weasel words because it looks like you're trying to weasel out of something.
I'm not saying that's true here, but in the industry that's the context.

Otherwise, nice job!

Make the indicated changes by the end of the semester and you'll have 
full credit on this portion of the project.
