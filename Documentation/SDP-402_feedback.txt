Software Development Plan Document
CMSI 402 -- CrowdVenture Project
======================================

Lovely job on this document, Ben!

Just one comment:

The project deliverables section is supposed to show PROJECT deliverables,
not CLASS deliverables.  All the things you have listed are most assuredly
due for the class, but the intent is for this section to show the PROJECT
deliverables, the things that you have listed in your Gantt chart, with a
brief explanation of each.

Other than that, everything looks good!  Nice job!

Make the indicated changes by the end of the semester and you'll have 
full credit on this portion of the project.
